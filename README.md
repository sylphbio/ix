# DO NOT USE THIS YET

this is made public solely as a necessary component of pontiff  
all aspects of it can and will change completely at any time without any notice  
presently being developed inhouse, issues and prs will be ignored

ix (short for interchange) is meant to be a portable data format similar in intent to xml or json  
specifically we intend it to be a formally specified sexp-based interchange format for communicating between scheme and haskell  
presently this library supports schemas, types (including sum and product types), and lenses  
it works pretty well, but is still my (alice) informal sketch of what we (sig and alice) intend to formally define soon-ish

our goal is to release a spec for ix/interchange, including text and binary formats  
then modify this to conform with the spec and freeze it as a reference implementation  
so if you use this do not be suprised if it changes completely out from under you  
caveat lector!
